            <p>Jeffrey Lynn Goldblum was born to Jewish parents in West Homestead, Pennsylvania, located just outside of Pittsburgh.[3][4] His mother, Shirley Jane Goldblum (née Temeles; October 30, 1926 – January 9, 2012),[5] was a radio broadcaster who later ran a kitchen equipment and appliances sales firm; his father, Harold Leonard Goldblum (April 25, 1920 – February 23, 1983), was a physician and major in the U.S. Army during World War II.[6][7] His family is from Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, with roots in Starobin and Zolochiv.[8] He has a sister, Pamela, and an elder brother, Lee. His other brother, Rick, whom Goldblum has described as a "kind of hero of mine", died in 1971 at age 23 while travelling in Morocco, having contracted dysentery which led to kidney failure. Goldblum credits his interest in jazz music to Rick's influence while they were growing up. He has stated that his brother's early death made him "more focused" and gave him a determination to "save myself and survive".[9][10]

                During his childhood, his parents were interested in show business.[11] His father nearly studied acting before deciding to pursue medical studies, going on to become chief of medicine at a Pittsburgh hospital.[9][12] Goldblum moved to New York City at 17 to become an actor. He worked on the stage and studied acting at the renowned Neighborhood Playhouse under the guidance of acting coach Sanford Meisner. He made his Broadway debut in the Tony Award-winning musical Two Gentlemen of Verona. He is an accomplished jazz pianist.</p>
